# Rethinking What Makes an Educational System Excellent (DATA 511)

This GitHub repo contains the app and all the data analysis that is used for our DATA 511 project. This repo is split into two folders: `education-app/` (frontend) and `data-analysis/` (processing). We will be using NextJS for our frontend, and using Python and Tableau for data analysis and visualization.

## Education App

We will host our visualization on a NextJS app that will be deployed onto Vercel. More information is given in the README.md under `education-app/`. However, as a quick reference, we can run the app by running the following commands.

```
cd education-app
pnpm dev
```

## Dataset

For our final project, we decide to analyze the PISA (Programme for International Student Assessment) 2022 dataset. The dataset is collected here:
